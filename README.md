# WASI I2C

A proposed [WebAssembly System Interface](https://github.com/WebAssembly/WASI) API.

### Current Phase

wasi-i2c is currently in [Phase 1](https://github.com/WebAssembly/WASI/blob/main/Proposals.md#phase-1---feature-proposal-cg)

### Champions

- Friedrich Vandenberghe
- Merlijn Sebrechts
- Maximilian Seidler

### Portability Criteria

WASI-I2C must have at least two complete independent implementations. One implementation must be implemented on a microcontroller.

### Introduction

The WASI-I2C proposal defines an API for the I2C protocol. The API of [embedded_hal](https://github.com/rust-embedded/embedded-hal) is closely followed.

Reference implementations can be found in [i2c-wasm-components](https://github.com/Zelzahn/i2c-wasm-components). Furthermore, there is also a [wasi-embedded-hal](https://crates.io/crates/wasi-embedded-hal) crate that implements the `embedded-hal` traits for the generated bindings.

### Goals

The primary goal is to provide an interface that WASI programs can use to read and write data over an I2C connection.

### Non-goals

Although I2C is in some aspects not that different from SPI, the purpose of this proposal is to solely focus on I2C.

### API walk-through

The full API documentation can be found [here](wasi-proposal-template.md).

[Walk through of how someone would use this API.]

#### [Use case 1]

[Provide example code snippets and diagrams explaining how the API would be used to solve the given problem]

#### [Use case 2]

[etc.]

### Detailed design discussion

#### Should this be combined with SPI, GPIO and PWM into 1 embedded proposal?

Although `embedded_hal` takes this approach, I would keep them separated for now. At least until each proposal is at least in Phase 2.

### Stakeholder Interest & Feedback

TODO before entering Phase 3.
